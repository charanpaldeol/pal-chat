# Pal Chat

This repository currently contains only a simple static page located in
`index.html`. The original application referenced Node.js servers and a
React-based chat interface, but those components are no longer included
here.

## Local preview

To view the placeholder page, simply open `index.html` in your browser.

The previous instructions for running `server.js`, starting the Express
API, and launching the `web-chat/` client have been removed because those
directories are not part of this repository.

## About

Pal Chat began as a demonstration of a basic messaging stack. The project
has since been pared down to this single HTML file. Feel free to build on
it or repurpose it as you see fit.
