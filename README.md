# Pal Chat

This repository currently contains only a static landing page: `index.html`. Previous revisions referenced a WebSocket relay server, an Express API, and a React web chat, but those components are not present here.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the placeholder page. The link on that page points to a web chat directory that has not yet been added.

## Missing Components

### WebSocket Relay Server
A Node.js relay server was originally planned to broadcast WebSocket messages between clients. It is not included in this repository.

### API Server
Documentation previously referenced an `server/` folder containing an Express API. That folder and server are not available in this version of the project.

### Web Chat
The React web client described as living in `web-chat/` is also absent. Once the client is added, this section will include setup instructions.
